# HairGoals
There’s an overwhelming amount of products available to those with curly and coily hair textures.
It’s difficult to decide on a product and decipher which style it should be used for.
Need a website that makes shopping for hair products easier.

User can use the website to search for hair products that serve different purposes. 
Users click a link to a website that sells the product.

Users can filter their search by:
1. Hair type
2. Desired Style
3. Price
4. Ingredients

Tools Used:
* ReactJS
* FireBase
* RedCircle API
* Rainforest API


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

# Project Timeline

### Week 1 (Saturday to Wednesday):

**Day 1 (Saturday):**
- **Morning: Kickoff Meeting**
  - Introduction to the project, emphasizing the role of React and APIs.
  - Discuss collaboration between React and Firebase teams.
  - Share resources for learning React and APIs.

- **Afternoon: Setup and Environment**
  - Set up Node.js, npm, and `create-react-app`.
  - Initiate a new React project:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app my-react-firebase-app
    ```

**Day 2 (Sunday):**
- **Morning: React Basics**
  - Introduce React concepts: components, state, props.
  - Modify the default React app to understand component structure.

- **Afternoon: Firebase Setup and Authentication Basics**
  - Set up Firebase for authentication.
  - Implement Firebase authentication basics (login and logout).
  - Discuss user authentication concepts.

**Day 3 (Monday):**
- **Morning: React Routing and Navigation**
  - Introduce React Router for navigation.
  - Create simple routes for different sections.

- **Afternoon: Firebase Firestore**
  - Set up Firestore for data storage.
  - Implement basic read and write operations to Firestore.

**Day 4 (Tuesday):**
- **Morning: Styling with CSS-in-JS (Styled Components)**
  - Introduce styling in React using Styled Components.
  - Implement basic styling for React components.

- **Afternoon: Rainforest API Integration**
  - Introduce Rainforest API and its purpose in the project.
  - Implement functionality to fetch data from Rainforest API.
  - Display the fetched data in the React app.

**Day 5 (Wednesday):**
- **Morning: State Management in React (useState and useContext)**
  - Introduce state management using `useState` and `useContext`.
  - Implement basic state management in the React app.

- **Afternoon: RedCircle API Integration**
  - Introduce RedCircle API and its role.
  - Implement functionality to fetch data from RedCircle API.
  - Integrate the fetched data into the React app.

### Future Weeks:

- Continue expanding functionality based on feedback and project requirements.
- Explore advanced React concepts such as useEffect, useContext, and custom hooks.
- Encourage understanding and utilization of both Firebase and the two APIs in different parts of the application.
- Consider introducing concepts of asynchronous programming and error handling in React.
- Regularly update and deploy the app, practicing version control with Git.

This timeline ensures a gradual understanding of React basics, Firebase integration, and API usage. Beginners can focus on mastering one concept at a time while building a fully functional app. Regular check-ins and code reviews are essential to guide their progress effectively.
